# COVID-19 Data Analysis

COVID-19 has ravaged the world and changed the course of history drastically. As of February 2021, it has infected more than 100,000,000 lives on earth - a number so large that it's too hard to fathom. Even among those who have not have contracted COVID, it has surely impacted them economically, socially, or psychologically. As an example, The U.S. metroplitian unemployment rate in Novemeber 2019 was estimated to be around 3.3% and in Novemeber 2020 it was estimated to be around 6.4% [1]. The OECD reported that in November 2020, over half of the world's population experienced a lockdown of some kind [2]. These numbers do not make one sleep soundly at night and demand immediate attention.


For data scientists and machine learning engineers, this can a perfect opportunity to contribute and help with valuable information - which is the purpose of this repository. There are two types of data that were analyzed: global economic impact data and vaccintaion data which will be periodically updated. The data analyzed in this repo come from two sources:

1. Our World In Data
2. Mendeley Data


A list of some the questions answered in this data analysis were the following:
- Which countries have the most vaccines?
- Which type of vaccines are the most popular?
- How many people are currently in serious or critical condition?
- How do cases differ by countries with varying GDP per capita?
- How do cases differ by countries with varying HDI?
- How has stringency impacted cases?
